PhysicsNeMo Tutorial: Solving 2D Lid Driven Cavity Flow with PINN
=================================================================
This tutorial uses PhysicsNeMo 1.3.0's FullyConnected model to implement
a PINN (Physics-Informed Neural Network) using PyTorch autograd.

Problem: 2D flow inside a box (Lid Driven Cavity)
- The top wall moves to the right, driving the flow
- The flow is governed by the Navier-Stokes equations

Learning objectives:
1. How to use PhysicsNeMo models
2. PINN fundamentals (computing PDE residuals via automatic differentiation)
3. GPU-accelerated training
4. Result visualization

How to run:
  cd E:\\physicsnemo_env
  Scripts\\activate
  python tutorial_pinn_ldc2d.py

==========================================================================
[What is PINN in One Sentence?]
==========================================================================

  A technique that teaches physics equations to a neural network so that
  the network itself discovers a solution that obeys the laws of physics.

  - Standard deep learning: provide labeled data and learn patterns (supervised)
  - PINN: instead of labeled data, provide physics equations and train the
          network to find a solution that satisfies them (equation = solution constraint)

# [1] Problem Setup - What physics problem are we solving?
# ============================================================================
# The problem we are solving is "2D flow inside a box (Lid Driven Cavity Flow)".
#
# This flow is described by the following equations (Navier-Stokes equations):
#
#  (1) Continuity equation (mass conservation):
#      du/dx + dv/dy = 0
#      -> "what comes in = what goes out" (fluid doesn't appear or disappear)
#      -> u: x-direction velocity, v: y-direction velocity
#
#  (2) Momentum equation - x-direction (fluid version of Newton's F=ma):
#      u*du/dx + v*du/dy = -dp/dx + nu*(d2u/dx2 + d2u/dy2)
#      -> Left side: inertia term (force from fluid's momentum)
#      -> Right first: pressure term (pressure difference pushes the fluid)
#      -> Right second: viscous term (fluid's stickiness; larger nu = more sticky)
#
#  (3) Momentum equation - y-direction:
#      u*dv/dx + v*dv/dy = -dp/dy + nu*(d2v/dx2 + d2v/dy2)
#
#  Variable descriptions:
#    u, v = x, y components of velocity (values we want to find)
#    p = pressure (value we want to find)
#    nu = kinematic viscosity (fluid stickiness; water < honey < tar)
#    rho = density (mass per unit volume)
#
# Reynolds number (Re): an important dimensionless number characterizing the flow
#   Re = 1/nu (in this problem)
#   Small Re -> strong viscosity -> laminar flow (smooth)
#   Large Re -> weak viscosity -> near-turbulent (complex flow)

NU = 0.01       # Kinematic viscosity (Reynolds number = 1/nu = 100, laminar flow)
RHO = 1.0       # Density (similar to water)

# Domain (the space to solve in): square box [0,1] x [0,1]
#
# Boundary conditions (what the velocity should be at each of the four walls):
#
#   Top wall (y=1): u=1, v=0    -> lid moves to the right at velocity 1 [KEY]
#   Bottom wall (y=0): u=0, v=0 -> bottom is fixed (does not move)
#   Left wall (x=0): u=0, v=0   -> left wall is fixed
#   Right wall (x=1): u=0, v=0  -> right wall is fixed
#
# Why boundary conditions matter: the top wall moving alone causes
# flow to develop throughout the entire box (like stirring water in a cup).

# Between each layer, an activation function (Tanh) adds nonlinearity.
# (Without activation functions, the network can only perform linear transformations)
#
# Why use Tanh?
#   - Tanh is a smooth curve in the range -1 to 1, differentiable and stable
#   - PINN requires 2nd-order derivatives, so a smoothly differentiable function is important
#   - ReLU is not differentiable at 0, making it unsuitable for PINNs
#

#   - A technique that makes training more stable
#   - Normalizes the magnitude of weights to prevent gradient explosion/vanishing

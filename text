Baking cakes is one of the standard tests for evaluating cooking perfor-mance of electric ovens, thereby manufacturers must secure the good level baking performance to meet the standards. However, baking the cakes every time for tests requires considerable cost and time, and there may be problems in terms of reproducibility. Several studies have been conducted using computational fluid dynamics to estimate the cooking performance of various types of convection baking ovens, but using simulation has some limitations since baking consists of complex chem-ical and physical process incorporating various types of heat transfer. In this study, authors used nylon replicas of cupcakes to surrogate real cupcake batter. Since temperature was chosen as a key factor that deter-mines baking quality from the preliminary study, a temperature sensor was mounted on top of each replica to record temperature profile during the tests. Throughout a series of tests simulating real baking cycle with various oven configurations, a correlation between baking quality of real cakes and temperature profile of replicas was obtained. In addition, it was also found that the overall cooking performance could be improved by minimizing the standard deviation of average temperature of each tray in oven.
